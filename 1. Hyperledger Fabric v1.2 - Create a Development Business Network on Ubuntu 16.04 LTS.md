# Tutorial 1: Hyperledger Fabric V1.2.0 - Create a Development Business Network on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

This article is a tutorial that guides you how to create a Hyperledger Fabric v.1.2.0 business network on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using the development tools that are found in the Hyperledger Fabric repository.

We will go through the process of setting up the Hyperledger Fabric prerequisites and later on we define and start Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network between three organizations.

## Recommended Reading
Before you start this tutorial, you may want to get familar with the basic concepts of Hyperledger Fabric. Official Hyperledger Fabric documentation provides comprehensive source of information related to Hyperledger Fabric configuration, modes of operation and prerequisites. We recommend to read the following articles and use them as the reference when going through this tutorial.

* Hyperledger Fabric Glossary - http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html

## Setup Your Environment
### Utility Packages
### Docker
Docker is a tool for deploying, executing, and managing containers. Hyperledger Fabric is by default packaged as a set of Docker images and it is ready to be run as Docker container.

To install the Docker, we can go to [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/):

**SETUP THE REPOSITORY**
```
# 1. Update the apt package index:
sudo apt-get update

# 2. Install packages to allow apt to use repository over HTTPS:
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common

# 3. Add Docker's official GPG key:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

# 4. Setup the stable repository.
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

**INSTALL THE DOCKER CE**
```
# 1. Update the apt package index
sudo apt-get update

# 2. Install the latest version of Docker CE
sudo apt-get install docker-ce

```

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. This is the case of Hyperledger Fabric default setup.

Docker Compose is typically installed as a part of your Docker installation. If not, it is necessary to install it separately. Run ```docker-compose --version``` command to find out if Docker Compose is present on your system.

To install Docker Compose on your Ubuntu 16.04 LTS system, please follow the instructions describe below or [follow the instruction how to install the docker compose in docker website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose):

```
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Check the Docker Compose version
docker-compose --version
```
### Go language

In this tutorial, we use the Go language as the basis of chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric. For Hyperledger Fabric, the Go language version is 1.7 or higher.

To install the Go language in the system, please follow the below instructions:

```
# Downloading the golang file
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.9.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Extract it in home directory
tar -xvf go1.9.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
Create a gopath directory in the **HOME directory**.
```
mkdir $HOME/gopath
```

Then we need to set the **Environment Variables** for our Golang in ~/.bashrc file such ```GOPATH```, ```GOROOT```, or ```GOBIN```.

```
export GOPATH=$HOME/gopath

export GOROOT=$HOME/go

export GOBIN=$HOME/go/bin

export PATH=$PATH:/$GOROOT/bin

```

Then run the command ```source ~/.bashrc``` to build the environment variables in the **.bashrc** file

## Retrieve Artifacts from Hyperledger Fabric Repsitories

To download and install Hyperledger Fabric binaries specific to your platform. This include downloading of ```cryptogen```, ```configtxgen```, ```configtxlator```, ```fabric-ca-client```, ```get-docker-images.sh```, ```orderer``` and ```peer``` tools and placing them into ```bin``` directory in the directory of your choice. In addition, the script will download Hyperlerdger Docker images into your local Docker registry.

Execute the following command to download Hyperledger Fabric binaries and Docker images:

```
curl -sSL http://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s 1.2.0
```

## Summary
At this point, our network is fully operational and this concludes our tutorial.

Here is a summary of the tasks that we completed:
- We installed all dependencies required to run Hyperledger Fabric v1.2. on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
- We retreived Hyperledger Fabric v1.2 artificats and binaries.
- We used the ```cryptogen``` tool to generate certificates and keys for the local MSP.
- We used the ```configtxgen``` tool to create our channel transaction and genesis block.
- We configured the ```docker-compose.yaml``` files to describe our networks and peers.
- We used the CLI container to perform the following tasks:
    - Create the channel
    - Deploy chaincode
    - Install chaincode
    - Invoke Chaincode
    - Query chaincode

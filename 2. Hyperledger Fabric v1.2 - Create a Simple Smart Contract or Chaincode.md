# Tutorial 2: Hyperledger Fabric v1.2 - Create a Simple Smart Contract or Chaincode

In Hyperledger Fabric, **chaincode** is the ***smart contract*** that runs on the peers and creates transactions. More broadly, it enables users to create transactions in the Hyperledger Fabric network's shared ledger and update the world state of the assets.

Chaincode is programmable code, written in Go, and instantiated on a channel. Developers use chaincode to develop business contracts, asset definitions, and collectively-managed decentralized applications.
